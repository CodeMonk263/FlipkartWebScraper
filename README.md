# FlipkartWebScraper
This scraper can scrape flipkart for laptops and return prices and ratings too

To run this type this in terminal -

>>>python3 run.py NO_OF_LAPTOPS PICKLE_DIR


It creates a separate folder in which it saves the pickled data as a text file called laptops.txt inside a folder that you named

The final code returns the pickled data as dictionary and also the count of the laptops scraped.

For the documented version just check the index.html file inside the html folder
